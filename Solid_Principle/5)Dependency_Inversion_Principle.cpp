Definition:
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. 
Both should depend on abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend on details. 
Details should depend on abstractions.

In simpler words, Rather than high-level classes controlling and depending on the details of lower-level ones, 
both should rely on interfaces or abstract classes. This makes your code flexible, testable, and easier to maintain.


Real-life Analogy
Lets say you are hungry and you want pizza. You use a food delivery app, and not contact the chef directly.

You (user) ‚Üí Use ‚Üí Food App (Abstraction)
Food App ‚Üí Deals with ‚Üí Restaurant/Chef (Implementation)

Understanding
You dont care which chef will make the pizza or how the pizza is made or who is your delivery partner ‚Äî you just want it delivered from your selected restaurant on time.

Here:
You = High-level module
Food App Interface = Abstraction
Restaurant = Low-level module






This is what exactly DIP suggests while writing code with industry standards ‚Äî high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
Instead, both should depend on abstractions.


// Without DIP ‚Äî Tightly Coupled Code

Code:
// Class implementing the recommendations based on recently added
class RecentlyAdded {
    // Method to get the recommendations
    public void getRecommendations() {
        System.out.println("Showing recently added content...");
    }
}

// Class implementing the overall Recommendation Engine
class RecommendationEngine {
    private RecentlyAdded recommender = new RecentlyAdded();

    public void recommend() {
        recommender.getRecommendations();
    }
}


// Issues in the above code:
RecommendationEngine is tightly coupled to RecentlyAdded.
If we want to switch to TrendingNow or GenreBased strategies, we have to modify the engine.









// Losely coupled 
// With DIP ‚Äî Using Abstraction

Code:
// Interface provided for classes to implement different recommendation strategies
interface RecommendationStrategy {
    void getRecommendations();
}

// Class implementing recommendations based on recently added
class RecentlyAdded implements RecommendationStrategy {
    public void getRecommendations() {
        System.out.println("Showing recently added content...");
    }
}

// Class implementing recommendations based on trending now
class TrendingNow implements RecommendationStrategy {
    public void getRecommendations() {
        System.out.println("Showing trending content...");
    }
}

// Class implementing recommendations based on Genre
class GenreBased implements RecommendationStrategy {
    public void getRecommendations() {
        System.out.println("Showing content based on your favorite genres...");
    }
}

// Class implementing the Recommendation Engine (High - level module)
// this doesnot know which concrete class to implement 
class RecommendationEngine {
    private RecommendationStrategy strategy;

    public RecommendationEngine(RecommendationStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void recommend() {
        strategy.getRecommendations();
    }
}

// Main driver code
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // If netfix -> after 6pm -> want to change the behaviour from trendingnow -> genre or recentlyUsed -> just change here
        RecommendationStrategy strategy = new TrendingNow(); // could also be RecentlyAdded or GenreBased
        RecommendationEngine engine = new RecommendationEngine(strategy);
        engine.recommend();
    }
}

// High level -> RecommendationEngine 
// Low level ->  TrendingNow,Genre  -> Concreate classes.
// Abstractions  -> RecommendationStrategy
// Details => Concrete Classes.

Explanation :
Principle	
1. High-level modules should not depend on low-level	-> 	RecommendationEngine depends only on RecommendationStrategy
2. Both should depend on abstractions	                ->  Both use the interface RecommendationStrategy
3. Abstractions should not depend on details            ->  RecommendationStrategy doesnt mention any concrete class
4. Details should depend on abstractions	            ->  TrendingNow, etc. implement the interface


You're referring to the **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**, which is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. Let's go through it **step by step**, using your code and breaking down **each of the 4 key points** in the DIP definition.

## üîÅ Dependency Inversion Principle

> ‚ÄúHigh-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
> Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.‚Äù

Let‚Äôs break this down:

---

### ‚úÖ **1. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules**

#### **What this means:**

* A **high-level module** contains the core business logic or policies (e.g., your `RecommendationEngine`).
* A **low-level module** deals with detailed implementation (e.g., `TrendingNow`, `RecentlyAdded`, `GenreBased`).
* The high-level module should **not directly depend** on the low-level details.

#### **In your code:**

* ‚úÖ `RecommendationEngine` is high-level.
* ‚úÖ `RecommendationStrategy` is an interface (abstraction).
* ‚úÖ `RecommendationEngine` depends only on the interface, **not** on specific classes like `TrendingNow`.

```java
// High-level module
class RecommendationEngine {
    private RecommendationStrategy strategy; // abstraction

    public RecommendationEngine(RecommendationStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void recommend() {
        strategy.getRecommendations();
    }
}
```

**‚úÖ So, this point is correctly followed.**

---

### ‚úÖ **2. Both should depend on abstractions**

#### **What this means:**

* Both the **high-level module (RecommendationEngine)** and the **low-level modules (e.g., TrendingNow)** should depend on **an interface or abstract class**.

#### **In your code:**

* ‚úÖ High-level module `RecommendationEngine` uses `RecommendationStrategy`.
* ‚úÖ Low-level modules (`TrendingNow`, etc.) **implement** `RecommendationStrategy`.

```java
interface RecommendationStrategy {
    void getRecommendations();
}
```

**‚úÖ This point is also correctly followed.**

---

### ‚úÖ **3. Abstractions should not depend on details**

#### **What this means:**

* The **interface** should not depend on any specific implementations or concrete classes.
* The interface should define the behavior **generically**.

#### **In your code:**

* ‚úÖ `RecommendationStrategy` defines only the method `getRecommendations()` with no knowledge of `TrendingNow`, `GenreBased`, etc.

**‚úÖ This point is followed.**

---

### ‚úÖ **4. Details should depend on abstractions**

#### **What this means:**

* The **concrete classes** (the low-level implementations) should implement the **interface**, not the other way around.
* So if you add a new type of recommendation, it should just implement the `RecommendationStrategy` interface.

#### **In your code:**

```java
class TrendingNow implements RecommendationStrategy {
    public void getRecommendations() {
        System.out.println("Showing trending content...");
    }
}
```

* ‚úÖ Each low-level class **depends on the abstraction** `RecommendationStrategy`.

**‚úÖ This point is also correctly followed.**

Factory Design Pattern: 
Goal: Hide the object creation logic and delegate it to a "factory" class. -> here we create (OperatingSystemFactory). 

Why: When you want to create objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client.


Real-world analogy:
Ordering food at a restaurant —: 
1. you tell the waiter what you want (input), 
2. and they bring the food (object),
3. but you don’t know how it’s prepared (creation logic).
